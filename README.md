==========

Tool to generate BYTE sequences for Go assembly as generated by YASM.

Example
-------

```
$ more example.s
                                                                 // VPADDQ  XMM0,XMM1,XMM8
$ asm2plan9s example.s
$ echo example.s
    BYTE $0xc4; BYTE $0xc1; BYTE $0x71; BYTE $0xd4; BYTE $0xc0   // VPADDQ  XMM0,XMM1,XMM8
```

The instruction to be assembled needs to start with a `//` at position **66** precisely. The preceeding characters will be overwitten by the correct sequence (irrespective of its contents).

Long instructions
-----------------

Instructions that result in more than 5 bytes are wrapped to the next line, for instance:

```
                                                                 // VPALIGNR XMM8, XMM12, XMM12, 0x8
```

will be assembled into

```
    BYTE $0xc4; BYTE $0x43; BYTE $0x19; BYTE $0x0f; BYTE $0xc4   // VPALIGNR XMM8, XMM12, XMM12, 0x8"
                BYTE $0x08"
```

Note the additional indent for the continued line. Upon a subsequent (re)assembly of the file the extra line is automatically detected and removed.
Also the extra line does not have to be there at first, so upon initially entering the instruction you can just start the following instruction on the next line.

Support for defines
-------------------

If you are using #define for 'macros' with the back-slash delimiter to continue on the next line, this will be preserved.

For instance:
```
                                                               \ // VPADDQ  XMM0,XMM1,XMM8
```

will be assembled into

```
    BYTE $0xc4; BYTE $0xc1; BYTE $0x71; BYTE $0xd4; BYTE $0xc0 \ // VPADDQ  XMM0,XMM1,XMM8
```
